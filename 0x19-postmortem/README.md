 Postmortem also known as incident report with the primary goal of understanding what went wrong, why it happened, and how similar incidents can be prevented in the future.

ISSUE SUMMARY:

This postmortem report provides a comprehensive analysis of the DDoS attack incident that occurred on January 15, 2024, between 8:00 PM and 1:00 AM (WAT). The incident was characterized by a malicious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, resulting in intermittent downtime and degraded service performance. Approximately 40% of users experienced disruptions, causing a significant impact on the organization’s web services. This report outlines the incident timeline, root cause analysis, impact assessment, and preventive measures to mitigate similar incidents in the future.

IMPACT DETAILS:

Incident Date and Time: January 15, 2024, 8:00 PM — 1:00 AM (WAT)

Incident Duration: 5 hours

Incident Severity: High

Incident Impact: Intermittent downtime, degraded service performance

Affected Systems/Services: Web applications, server infrastructure

Incident Response Team: Security Response Team, Network Operations Team

TIMELINE:

January 15, 8:00 PM: Unusual spike in traffic detected; DDoS protection system alerted.

January 15, 8:15 PM: Incident response team activated; initial investigation launched.

January 15, 9:00 PM: DDoS attack confirmed; mitigation measures initiated.

January 15, 10:00 PM: Collaborated with DDoS mitigation service provider to optimize filtering rules.

January 15, 11:00 PM: Mitigation efforts ongoing; services still experiencing intermittent downtime.

January 16, 12:00 AM: Successfully mitigated the DDoS attack; services gradually restored.

January 16, 1:00 AM: Incident resolved, and network stability regained.

ROOT CAUSE:

The root cause of the service disruptions was a malicious Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting the organization’s web services. The attack flooded the network with traffic, overwhelming server capacity and causing intermittent downtime.

RESOLUTION:

The incident was resolved through the implementation of filtering rules to block malicious traffic. Collaborative efforts with the DDoS mitigation service provider were crucial in optimizing filtering rules and ensuring the timely mitigation of the attack. Services were gradually restored as the filtering mechanisms took effect.

CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES:

Enhance DDoS Detection: Improve DDoS detection algorithms to enhance early identification of potential attacks.

Regularly Review and Update Mitigation Strategies: Periodically review and update DDoS mitigation strategies to adapt to evolving attack techniques.

Implement Redundancy and Failover Mechanisms: Introduce redundancy and failover mechanisms to enhance service availability during DDoS attacks.

Educational Programs: Conduct educational programs for the IT and security teams to stay informed about emerging DDoS attack vectors and mitigation techniques.

In summary, this postmortem report provides insights into the response, resolution, and preventive measures following a DDoS attack, ensuring a more resilient and secure web infrastructure for the organization.
